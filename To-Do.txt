AttendanceApp To-Do

NON-SPECIFIC:
- Look into how we could make the app downloadable, as well as how we would allow it to be downloaded(via website, discord, play store,etc?)
- Somehow allow the app to be able to identify if the phone is on the NeSCC network (also a prompt that will prohibit app usage if the phone is not connected to NeSCC network)
- An instructor will be able to send a message to a student's app; look into how this would work (will have to work with the Desktop team)

SPECIFIC:
- LOGIN PAGE: Create a concrete page that kinda becomes the default page after a user has logged in (Will have a navigation menu to switch between other pages such as 
	the Semester page or the Scanner page.) This will allow the user to navigate easily w/o having to login every time they want to switch pages.
- SCANNER PAGE: Integrate camera 
- SCANNER PAGE: Add pop up box when a Barcode is scanned (Either confirming that the barcode has been scanned or that the scan failed followed by the reason for failure, 	whether is the incorrect day/time, incorrect barcode,etc.)
- SEMESTER PAGE: Somehow create/integrate an attendance record
- Add comments to parts of the code that may seem vague/hard to understand
