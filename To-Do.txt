AttendanceApp To-Do

NON-SPECIFIC:
- Look into how we could make the app downloadable, as well as how we would allow it to be downloaded(via website, discord, play store,etc?)
- Somehow allow the app to be able to identify if the phone is on the NeSCC network (also a prompt that will prohibit app usage if the phone is not connected to NeSCC network)
- An instructor will be able to send a message to a student's app; look into how this would work (will have to work with the Desktop team)

SPECIFIC:
- SCANNER PAGE: Add pop up box when a Barcode is scanned (Either confirming that the barcode has been scanned or that the scan failed followed by the reason for failure, 
	whether is the incorrect day/time, incorrect barcode,etc.)
- SEMESTER PAGE: Integrate an attendance record (Will be created by Desktop-Team)
- Add comments to parts of the code that may seem vague/hard to understand
